# Travel Estimator Service Fix Steps

## Steps to Fix:
- [x] Fix sellers array structure in TravelEstimatorService to include 'distance' key
- [x] Update estimateTravel method to ensure sellers have 'distance' key
- [x] Update fallbackTravelResult method to ensure sellers have 'distance' key
- [ ] Verify distance calculation logic is correct
- [ ] Test the fixes to ensure no "Undefined array key 'distance'" error
- [ ] Test distance calculation accuracy between sellers and customer

## Current Issues:
1. "Failed to calculate pseudo-order: Undefined array key 'distance'" error
2. Incorrect distance calculation between sellers and customer

## Root Cause:
- AIController expects 'distance' key in sellers array but TravelEstimatorService returns 'distance_from_previous' in optimal route
- Mismatch between data structure expectations

## Changes Made:
- Updated estimateTravel method to transform sellers array to include 'distance' key
- Updated fallbackTravelResult method to ensure sellers array includes 'distance' key
- Both methods now provide the expected data structure for AIController
