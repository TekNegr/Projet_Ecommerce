# Travel Estimator Service Fix Plan

## Issues to Fix:
1. ✅ Remove redundant distance calculations
2. ✅ Implement proper route optimization (nearest neighbor algorithm)
3. ✅ Fix distance calculation logic to avoid double counting
4. ✅ Improve error handling and logging
5. ✅ Ensure API efficiency

## Steps:
- [x] Analyze current TravelEstimatorService implementation
- [x] Create fix plan
- [x] Implement route optimization algorithm
- [x] Remove redundant distance calculations
- [x] Improve error handling
- [x] Update TravelEstimatorService implementation
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Update AIController if needed for new response format
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

## Changes Made:
- Refactored estimateTravel() method to use optimal routing
- Removed redundant distance calculations
- Added nearest neighbor algorithm for route optimization
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added validation for API responses
