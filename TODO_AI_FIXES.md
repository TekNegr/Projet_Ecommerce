# AI Service Fixes Plan

## Issues Fixed:
1. ✅ Complete rewrite of TravelEstimatorService with comprehensive logging
2. ✅ Fixed delivery_time type error (float vs integer) in AIController
3. ✅ Implemented coordinate-based distance calculation using Geoapify geocoding
4. ✅ Correct travel route calculation: furthest seller -> ... -> closest seller -> customer
5. ✅ Added proper error handling and logging throughout

## Implementation Details:
- Uses Geoapify API for address geocoding to coordinates
- Calculates distances using Haversine formula between coordinates
- Sorts sellers by distance to customer (furthest first)
- Calculates travel route iteratively between sellers
- Comprehensive logging at every step
- Proper error handling for failed geocoding

## Testing Status:
- Code implementation completed
- Manual testing needed for AI dashboard form submission
- Geoapify API integration testing needed
- Error scenario testing needed

## Next Steps:
- Test the AI dashboard functionality
- Verify Geoapify API integration works
- Check error handling scenarios
- Monitor logs for any issues
